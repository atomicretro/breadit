Not I !\n\nIn the flush of the hot June prime,\n   O’er sleek flood-tides afire,\nI hear him hurry the chime\n   To the bidding of checked Desire;\n   Till the sweated ringers tire\nAnd the wild bob-majors die.\n   Could I wait for my turn in the godly choir?\n(Shoal! ’Ware shoal!)

Not I!\n\nThrough the blur of the whirling snow,\n   Or the black of the inky sleet,\nThe lanterns gather and grow,\n   And I look for the homeward fleet.\n   Rattle of block and sheet—\n‘Ready about—stand by!’\n   Shall I ask them a fee ere they fetch the quay?\n(Shoal! ’Ware shoal!) Not I!\n\nI dip and I surge and I swing\n   In the rip of the racing tide,\nBy the gates of doom I sing,\n   On the horns of death I ride.\n   A ship-length overside,\nBetween the course and the sand,\n   Fretted and bound I bide\n             Peril whereof I cry.\nWould I change with my brother a league inland?\n(Shoal! ’Ware shoal!)

raven_poem = Poem.create(title: "The Raven", author: poe, body:
  "Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,\nOver many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\n    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\nAs of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.\n“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—\n            Only this and nothing more.”\n\n    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;\nAnd each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n    Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\nFor the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n            Nameless here for evermore.\n\n    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\nThrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\nSome late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n            This it is and nothing more.”\n\n    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\n            Darkness there and nothing more.\n\n    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\nThis I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\n            Merely this and nothing more.\n\n    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\nSoon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\nLet my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n\n    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\nIn there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n\nThen this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\nBy the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\nGhastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\nTell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\nThough its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\nBird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n            With such name as “Nevermore.”\n\n    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\nThat one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\nOn the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\n            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n\n    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\nTill the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n\n    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n\n    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\nBut whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\n            She shall press, ah, nevermore!\n\n    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\nSwung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\n    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\nIs there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\nBy that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\n    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”\n            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n\n    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;\n    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,\n    And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;\nAnd my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor\n            Shall be lifted—nevermore!")

I see you face to face! \nClouds of the west—sun there half an hour high—I see you also face to face. \n\nCrowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious you are to me! \nOn the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning home, are more curious to me than you suppose, \nAnd you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose. \n\n2 \nThe impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day, \nThe simple, compact, well-join’d scheme, myself disintegrated, every one disintegrated yet part of the scheme, \nThe similitudes of the past and those of the future, \nThe glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on the walk in the street and the passage over the river, \nThe current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away, \nThe others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them, \nThe certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others. \n\nOthers will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore, \nOthers will watch the run of the flood-tide, \nOthers will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the heights of Brooklyn to the south and east, \nOthers will see the islands large and small; \nFifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half an hour high, \nA hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others will see them, \nWill enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide. \n\n3 \nIt avails not, time nor place—distance avails not, \nI am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence, \nJust as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt, \nJust as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd, \nJust as you are refresh’d by the gladness of the river and the bright flow, I was refresh’d, \nJust as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift current, I stood yet was hurried, \nJust as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d. \n\nI too many and many a time cross’d the river of old, \nWatched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies, \nSaw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow, \nSaw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south, \nSaw the reflection of the summer sky in the water, \nHad my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams, \nLook’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water, \nLook’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward, \nLook’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet, \nLook’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving, \nSaw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me, \nSaw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor, \nThe sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars, \nThe round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants, \nThe large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses, \nThe white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels, \nThe flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset, \nThe scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening, \nThe stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks, \nOn the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter, \nOn the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night, \nCasting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets. \n\n4 \nThese and all else were to me the same as they are to you, \nI loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river, \nThe men and women I saw were all near to me, \nOthers the same—others who look back on me because I look’d forward to them, \n(The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.) \n\n5 \nWhat is it then between us? \nWhat is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us? \n\nWhatever it is, it avails not—distance avails not, and place avails not, \nI too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine, \nI too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it, \nI too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me, \nIn the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me, \nIn my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me, \nI too had been struck from the float forever held in solution, \nI too had receiv’d identity by my body, \nThat I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body. \n\n6 \nIt is not upon you alone the dark patches fall, \nThe dark threw its patches down upon me also, \nThe best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious, \nMy great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre? \nNor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil, \nI am he who knew what it was to be evil, \nI too knitted the old knot of contrariety, \nBlabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d, \nHad guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak, \nWas wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant, \nThe wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me, \nThe cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting, \nRefusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting, \nWas one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest, \nWas call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing, \nFelt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat, \nSaw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word, \nLived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping, \n\nPlay’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress, \nThe same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like, \nOr as small as we like, or both great and small. \n\n7 \nCloser yet I approach you, \nWhat thought you have of me now, I had as much of you—I laid in my stores in advance, \nI consider’d long and seriously of you before you were born. \n\nWho was to know what should come home to me? \nWho knows but I am enjoying this? \nWho knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you now, for all you cannot see me?\n\n8 \nAh, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than mast-hemm’d Manhattan? \nRiver and sunset and scallop-edg’d waves of flood-tide? \nThe sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the twilight, and the belated lighter? \n\nWhat gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as I approach? \nWhat is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that looks in my face? \nWhich fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you? \n\nWe understand then do we not? \nWhat I promis’d without mentioning it, have you not accepted? \nWhat the study could not teach—what the preaching could not accomplish is accomplish’d, is it not? \n\n9 \nFlow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide! \nFrolic on, crested and scallop-edg’d waves! \nGorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the men and women generations after me! \nCross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers! \nStand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn! \nThrob, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers! \nSuspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution! \nGaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly! \n\nSound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my nighest name! \nLive, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress! \nPlay the old role, the role that is great or small according as one makes it! \nConsider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be looking upon you; \nBe firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet haste with the hasting current; \nFly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air; \nReceive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all downcast eyes have time to take it from you! \nDiverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any one’s head, in the sunlit water! \nCome on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail’d schooners, sloops, lighters! \nFlaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower’d at sunset! \nBurn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses! \n\nAppearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are, \nYou necessary film, continue to envelop the soul, \nAbout my body for me, and your body for you, be hung out divinest aromas, \nThrive, cities—bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and sufficient rivers, \nExpand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual, \nKeep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting. \n\nYou have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers, \nWe receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward, \nNot you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us, \nWe use you, and do not cast you aside—we plant you permanently within us, \nWe fathom you not—we love you—there is perfection in you also, \nYou furnish your parts toward eternity, \nGreat or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.")

\nI do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea. \n\nThere is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well, \nAll things please the soul, but these please the soul well. \n\n5 \nThis is the female form, \nA divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot, \nIt attracts with fierce undeniable attraction, \nI am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it, \nBooks, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed, \nMad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable, \nHair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused, \nEbb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching, \nLimitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice, \nBridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn, \nUndulating into the willing and yielding day, \nLost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day. \n\nThis the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman, \nThis the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again. \n\nBe not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest, \nYou are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul. \n\nThe female contains all qualities and tempers them, \nShe is in her place and moves with perfect balance, \nShe is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active, \nShe is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters. \n\nAs I see my soul reflected in Nature, \nAs I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty, \nSee the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see. \n\n6 \nThe male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place, \nHe too is all qualities, he is action and power, \nThe flush of the known universe is in him, \nScorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well, \nThe wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him, \nThe full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul, \nKnowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself, \nWhatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here, \n(Where else does he strike soundings except here?) \n\nThe man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred, \nNo matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang? \nIs it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf? \nEach belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you, \nEach has his or her place in the procession. \n\n(All is a procession, \nThe universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.) \n\nDo you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant? \nDo you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight? \nDo you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts, \nFor you only, and not for him and her? \n\n7 \nA man’s body at auction, \n(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,) \nI help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business. \n\nGentlemen look on this wonder, \nWhatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it, \nFor it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant, \nFor it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d. \n\nIn this head the all-baffling brain, \nIn it and below it the makings of heroes. \n\nExamine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve, \nThey shall be stript that you may see them. \n\nExquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition, \nFlakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs, \nAnd wonders within there yet. \n\nWithin there runs blood, \nThe same old blood! the same red-running blood! \nThere swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations, \n(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?) \n\nThis is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns, \nIn him the start of populous states and rich republics, \nOf him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments. \n\nHow do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries? \n(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?) \n\n8 \nA woman’s body at auction, \nShe too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers, \nShe is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers. \n\nHave you ever loved the body of a woman? \nHave you ever loved the body of a man? \nDo you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth? \n\nIf any thing is sacred the human body is sacred, \nAnd the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted, \nAnd in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face. \n\nHave you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body? \nFor they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves. \n\n9 \nO my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you, \nI believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,) \nI believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems, \nMan’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems, \nHead, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears, \nEyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids, \nMouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges, \nNose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition, \nCheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue, \nStrong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest, \nUpper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones, \nWrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails, \nBroad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side, \nRibs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone, \nHips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root, \nStrong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above, \nLeg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg, \nAnkles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel; \nAll attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female, \nThe lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean, \nThe brain in its folds inside the skull-frame, \nSympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity, \nWomanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman, \nThe womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings, \nThe voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud, \nFood, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming, \nPoise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening, \nThe continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes, \nThe skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair, \nThe curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body, \nThe circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out, \nThe beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees, \nThe thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones, \nThe exquisite realization of health; \nO I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul, \nO I say now these are the soul!")
